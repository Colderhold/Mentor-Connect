# Mentorship QR Code Communication System


**Overview**

Effective communication and engagement between mentors and mentees are crucial for successful mentorship programs. Traditional methods often lack efficiency and real-time interaction. This project addresses this challenge by implementing QR code-based solutions to create seamless and dynamic communication channels between mentors and mentees.


**Methodology / Technology Used**

In this project, QR (Quick Response) codes serve as a technology bridge to facilitate improved mentor-mentee interactions. Mentors and mentees are assigned unique QR codes, which, when scanned using smartphones or other QR code readers, lead to personalized digital platforms. These platforms enable real-time communication, goal setting, progress tracking, and resource sharing.


**Key Methodologies:**

QR Code Generation: Python is utilized, along with libraries like 'qrcode', to dynamically generate QR codes assigned to mentors and mentees.

Web Application Development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are employed for front-end development, creating user-friendly interfaces for both mentors and mentees.

Backend Development: Flask, a Python web framework, handles user authentication, database management, and data processing.

Database Management: MySQL is utilized to store user profiles, goals, and progress.

Hosting: Local development is facilitated using XAMPP, a cross-platform web server solution stack package.


**Features**

Real-time Communication: Enable direct interaction between mentors and mentees through personalized digital platforms.

Goal Setting and Tracking: Facilitate goal setting and track progress towards these goals in real-time.

Resource Sharing: Centralized repository for educational materials, articles, tutorials, and tools relevant to mentorship.

Feedback Mechanism: Allow for feedback and evaluation between mentors and mentees to enhance mentorship experiences.

Efficient Communication: Replace traditional communication methods with QR code-based solutions for more efficient communication.


**Technology Used**

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python (Flask), PHP (XAMPP)

Database: MySQL

Hosting: Vercel Platform (Production), XAMPP (Local Development)
