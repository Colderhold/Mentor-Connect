<h2 style="text-align:center;">Mentor Portal</h2>
<br>
<p>We are a platform that connects mentors and mentees to help them achieve their goals.
    Whether you are a seasoned professional looking to give back or an aspiring individual
    seeking guidance, we have a mentor for you.</p>
    <h4>What is mentoring?</h4>
    <p>Mentoring is a relationship between two people where the mentor provides guidance, support,
    and advice to the mentee. Mentors can help mentees develop their skills, navigate their
    careers, and achieve their personal and professional goals.</p>
    <h4>Why is mentoring important?</h4>
    <p>Mentoring can have a significant impact on both the mentor and the mentee. Mentees benefit
    from the knowledge, experience, and insights of their mentors. Mentors also benefit from the
    relationship, as it gives them the opportunity to share their expertise and help others succeed.</p>
